<h1>Village: The Web3-Powered Social Accountability App</h1>

Built by an ambitious product manager with a LOT of help from AI:
- Front-end: Lovable (React, Vite)
- Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- Smart Contracts & Wallets: Flow Blockchain (Cadence)

<h2>🌱 Core Idea</h2>

Village is a Web3 accountability platform that empowers users to reach their goals together. Users join “Villages” (small goal-driven communities), stake assets using Flow, and stay on track through social motivation and smart contract-enforced rewards and penalties.

“It takes a village.” We turn that into action.

<h2>✅ MVP Features</h2>

Create a Village & Invite Friends: Users create accountability groups and invite friends.

Join a Village & Stake Funds: Members connect wallets and stake required funds/tokens to join the group.

Submit Activity: Members submit their proof of completion / progress towards their goals.

Smart Contract Verification: Flow smart contract verifies group creation, staked funds, goal completion, and reward distribution.

Reward Distribution: Flow smart contract holds staked assets in escrow until the challenge is over, then it distributes the reward to successful members.


<h2>🔁 User Flow</h2>

Create a Village:
- Set group name, description, goal, start and end date, stake amount, and reward structure.
- Share invite code / link.

Join & Stake:
- New members connect their Flow/Blocto wallet and agree to stake required funds to join a village.

Submit Activity:
- Members upload proof of their progress (e.g. workout screenshots) as activities on the app.
- App tracks number of activities and shows progress towards the goal.

Goal Completion Verification:
- At the end of the challenge, the Flow smart contract checks goal completion. Members who failed to complete the goal forfeit all or part of their staked funds.

Payout:
- Flow smart contract distributes the prize pool (rewards) to the wallets of successful members who achieved their goals.
