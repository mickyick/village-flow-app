<h1>Village: The Web3-Powered Social Accountability App</h1>

Built by an ambitious product manager with a LOT of help from AI:
- Front-end: Lovable (React, Vite)
- Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- Smart Contracts & Wallets: Flow Blockchain (Cadence)

<h2>üå± Core Idea</h2>

Village is a Web3 accountability platform that empowers users to reach their goals together. Users join ‚ÄúVillages‚Äù (small goal-driven communities), stake assets using Flow, and stay on track through social motivation and smart contract-enforced rewards and penalties.

‚ÄúIt takes a village.‚Äù We turn that into action.

<h2>üí° Why This Has "Killer App" Potential</h2>

1Ô∏è‚É£ Solves a Real Pain Point ‚Äì Many people struggle to stay consistent with habits. Social accountability + skin in the game + rewards makes goals easier and more fun to achieve.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Unique in Web3 ‚Äì Most web3 consumer apps focus on DeFi, NFTs, or gaming. Few focus on behavioral incentives for personal growth.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Naturally uses Flow‚Äôs strengths ‚Äì Flow is great for consumer-friendly dApps, walletless onboarding, scalability, programmable rewards, and NFTs.

<h2>‚úÖ MVP Features</h2>
